# HackBio-Genomics-Internship
Projects and tasks from the 2022 HackBio Genomics Workshop

With genomics sparks a revolution in medical discoveries, it becomes imperative to be able to better understand the genome, and be able to leverage the data and information from genomic datasets.
This internship covered the concepts and tools to understand, analyze, and interpret data from next generation sequencing experiments.

Skills learnt included and was not limited to:
Linux
Git
BASH
Genomic Data Analysis
Phylogenetics

Highlight of the Program
The program was structured into 5 stages

Stage 0 was focused on mastering a programming language. In practice, this could be either be Python, R or Born again Shell (BASh).
Stage 1 was dedicated to applying learnt programming skills to solve simple to intermediate problems in biotechnology including molecular biology, epigenetics, gene & protein engineering.
Stage 2 was where learners reproduced existing bioinformatics pipelines, tutorials and projects
Stage 3 was focused on working in teams to solve interesting bioinformatics tasks.
Stage 4 was dedicated finalizing participants' project. 

A detailed report (including technical language) of the project was published on medium.
